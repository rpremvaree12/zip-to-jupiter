# zip-to-jupiter

This project was made possible thanks to the work of [Margaret Tanzosh](https://github.com/cs50nestm). Margaret created a Python script to streamline the grading process, which she demonstrated during a Math for America workshop she facilitated. With her permission, I adapted her code to build this web application.
